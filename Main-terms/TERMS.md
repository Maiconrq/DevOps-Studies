# Devops Main Terms

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: the practice of integrating project code frequently, often several times per day. This allows errors to be detected and corrected quickly.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: the practice of releasing software updates frequently and automatically. This allows updates to be implemented quickly and with less effort.

3. **Real-time Monitoring**: the practice of monitoring systems in real-time to detect problems or failures. This allows problems to be identified and corrected quickly.

4. **Containers**: ways of packaging and distributing applications in a portable manner. This allows applications to run consistently in any environment.

5. **Container Orchestration**: the practice of managing and scheduling containers in a cluster of computers. This allows applications to run efficiently and scalably.

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: the practice of managing IT infrastructure configuration as code, allowing it to be versioned and controlled in a similar way to application code.

7. **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)**: the practice of managing the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to release and maintenance. This includes continuous integration, continuous delivery, real-time monitoring, and other DevOps practices.

8. **Automated Testing**: software tests that are run automatically, allowing the software to be checked for proper functioning quickly and consistently.

9. **Code Integrity**: the practice of checking the quality of project code, often through automated checks using code analysis tools. This allows problems in the code to be identified quickly and ensures the quality of the software.

10. **Configuration Management**: the practice of managing system configurations consistently and controlled. This allows systems to be configured correctly and standardized, which is important for ensuring the integrity and performance of systems.

11. **Microservices**: a software architecture in which the application is divided into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific task. This allows the application to be scaled and maintained more efficiently.

12. **Cloud**: the use of IT services provided by a third-party company through the internet. This allows systems to run more efficiently and scalably, as computing resources are allocated dynamically as needed.
